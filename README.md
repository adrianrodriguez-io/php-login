# php-login
Login and register system developed in PHP. 

First step is to create the tables with sqlcode.sql script where email and encrypted password are placed. 

This development support redirecting logic based on different use cases when user try to login or register, eg When registering email already exist, this wont allow the user to register.

Once the user is logged he/she is redirected to a main page where the content is placed.
